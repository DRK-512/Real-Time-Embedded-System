# Real-Time-Embedded-System

This repo consists of all the labs I did during my real-time embedded systems class at Kettering University
I will be updating this to show just the code

I do someday want to get back to this and re-learn some RTOS stuff, so this repo will be optimized in the future

But for now please ignore the poor formatting of code presented
